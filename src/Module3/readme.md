# Task

1. Create ArrayList and LinkedList containing 100 000 Integer elements. Compare time intervals.
2. Insert new 1000 elements on the beginning, on the middle and on the end of ones. Compare time intervals.
3. Update 1000 elements from the beginning, from the middle and from the end of ones. Compare time intervals.
4. Delete 1000 elements from the beginning, from the middle  and from the end of ones. Compare time intervals.

## Task solution
This program contains methods for filling, inserting, updating and deleting elements from ArrayList and LinkedList.
All methods also do execution time measurement. Each of them returns the value of measured execution time.

##All results can be seen in Main.java class.
