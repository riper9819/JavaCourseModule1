# Module 3

## Task 1

1. Create ArrayList and LinkedList containing 100 000 Integer elements. Compare time intervals.
2. Insert new 1000 elements on the beginning, on the middle and on the end of ones. Compare time intervals.
3. Update 1000 elements from the beginning, from the middle and from the end of ones. Compare time intervals.
4. Delete 1000 elements from the beginning, from the middle  and from the end of ones. Compare time intervals.

### Task solution
Class Main.java is the main class of the program.\
This class has solutions for all task items.\

## Laboratory work 2

Laboratory work 2. Object-oriented programming. JavaCollectionFramework.\
Choose a subject according to your number. Develop a service using all your best in OOP and Java collections.\
Six methods must be written like in the following example. A point for each one.

Subject: Cafe - standard lunch and ordering.

### Laboratory work solution
This program contains 4 classes:
1. Class Cafe.java is main class of the program.
2. Class Customer.java contains Customer object constructor and customer methods.
3. Class Meal.java contains Meal object constructor and meal methods.
4. Class IMeal contains Meal object methods.
